    ●	cd CoreChronicles
    ●	pip install psycopg2
    ●	pip install psycopg2-binary
    ●	python manage.py runserver
    
*pgadmin create database

We move to the folder that has the project

    * python3 manage.py runserver
    
In Django, an application is a web application that does something – a self-contained feature or functionality of your project. Think of it as a specific district or neighborhood within our city, dedicated to a particular purpose, 
like residential, commercial, or industrial. Create your first app with:

    python manage.py startapp myapp
    
Replace myapp with a suitable name for your application. This command creates a new directory with your app’s name, containing the basic files needed to start building your app.
Registering the App and DRF

Update the INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py to include 'rest_framework' and your app.

    INSTALLED_APPS = [...,
    'rest_framework',
    'myapp',
    ...
    ]
    
Configuring Django to Use PostgreSQL
Update the DATABASES settings in settings.py with your PostgreSQL credentials.

     DATABASES = {
        'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'corechronilesdatabase',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': 'yourpassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
      }
    }

To create a REST API endpoint based on the specifications and code you provided, we'll integrate the Django models, serializers, and views into a Django project. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Set up a Django project:

If you haven't already, install Django (pip install django) and create a new project 
(django-admin startproject myproject).
Navigate into the project directory (cd myproject).

2. Create Django apps:

Inside the project directory, create a new Django app (django-admin startapp myapp).
This app will contain the models, serializers, views, and URLs for your REST API.

3. Models:

Copy the model definitions from your provided code and paste them into models.py inside 
your app directory (myproject/myapp/models.py).

4. Serializers:

Copy the serializer definitions from your provided code and paste them into 
serializers.py inside your app directory (myproject/myapp/serializers.py).

5. Views:

Copy the view functions and classes from your provided code and paste them into 
views.py inside your app directory (myproject/myapp/views.py).

6. URLs:

Copy the URL patterns from your provided code and paste them into urls.py inside your 
app directory (myproject/myapp/urls.py).
Ensure you import the necessary views (from . import views) at the top of the file.

7. Settings:

In your project's settings.py, add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list ('myapp').
Make sure your project's urls.py includes your app's URLs. You might include them using 
the include function (path('api/', include('myapp.urls'))).

8. Run Migrations:

Run python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate to apply the 
model changes to your database.

9. Test the API:

Start your Django development server with python manage.py runserver.
Use tools like Insomnia or Postman to interact with your API endpoints.
Follow the instructions provided in the "Using Insomnia" section to authenticate and make 
requests to your API endpoints.

10. Integrate AWS S3 (Optional):

If you want to integrate AWS S3 for file storage, follow the steps provided under the "Implementing AWS S3 with Django" section.
Make sure to install the required packages (django-storages and boto3) and configure your settings accordingly.]

11. Implement Throttling and Permissions (Optional):

If you want to implement throttling and permissions as described in the provided code, follow the instructions under the 
"Implementing Throttling in Django REST Framework (DRF)" section.

12. Implement Pagination (Optional):

If you want to implement pagination as described in the provided code, follow the instructions 
under the "Implementing Pagination in Django REST Framework (DRF)" section.
